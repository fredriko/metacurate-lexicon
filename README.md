# Metacurate Lexicon

The metacurate lexicon is available at 
[https://metacurate-lexicon.herokuapp.com/](https://metacurate-lexicon.herokuapp.com/) 
(it is running on a free dyno, so it takes 30 seconds or so to spin it up). 
It is a python/Flask web application that exposes interfaces (a web GUI and a RESTful API) for looking up 
semantically similar (multi-word) terms in a lexicon, as well as the appropriate pre-processing of raw text 
into sentences and term tokens. The word embeddings in the lexicon are generated by the gensim word2vec 
implementation, and the recognition of multi-word terms is based on gensim Phraser:s.

The metacurate lexicon, and the accompanying API, are the results of an investigation into the feasibility 
to deploy a web service that uses a reasonably large set of word embeddings to platform-as-a-service Heroku.

Upcoming features at [metacurate.io](https://metacurate.io) require access to a lexicon of semantically similar 
multi-word terms. Since metacurate.io is hosted on [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), 
I wanted to find out whether the required semantic lexicon functionality can be deployed to heroku too,
without violating their application size constraints.

The answer is *yes*.





## How to run the web service locally

### Pre-requisites and installation

You will need:

* Python 3.6
* virutalenv 

Optional: If you plan on using retrieve and use the data from metacurate.io, you will also 
need to have a MongoDb instance running (see section *The data* below). 

* Create a virtual environment, let's call it *metacurate-lexicon*
* *pip install -r requirements.txt*
