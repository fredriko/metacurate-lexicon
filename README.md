# TODO
* Add API, e.g., GET /api/v1/lookup, POST /api/v1/normalize.
* Investigate accounts, authentication, and quota for API.
* Make first page use GET instead of POST so as to allow for bookmarks and links.
* Elaborate on about-page, e.g., training, multi-word expressions, metacurate.io, etc.
* Refine this readme to allow for public github repo.
* Get and display information about the lexicon, e.g., how many entries, common multi-word expressions, etc.
* Add morphology to lookup results
